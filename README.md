# 🌙 Dark Mode Transformer

A powerful yet minimal Chrome extension that instantly applies a customizable dark mode to any website. Supports both **global** dark mode and **per-website** filters, giving you full control of your browsing comfort.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Toggle dark mode on the current page
- 🌐 Enable dark mode globally across all websites
- 📵 Exclude specific websites permanently or for a single session
- ⚙️ Clean, user-friendly popup interface
- 🧠 Automatically injects dark mode on tab updates
- 💾 Syncs settings across your browser using Chrome Sync and Session Storage

## 🔧 How It Works

The extension uses simple CSS filters (`invert()` and `hue-rotate()`) to transform light-themed websites into dark ones. You can exclude websites temporarily (per session) or permanently using the filter manager in the popup UI.
